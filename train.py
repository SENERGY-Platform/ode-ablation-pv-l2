"""Entry point of an experiment: train once, record the run, exit.

The deployed operator starts at main.py, where Operator Lib takes the process,
trains if no model is registered yet, and then consumes Kafka until it is stopped.
An experiment wants the first half of that and not the second, so this file runs
Operator Lib's own init sequence and stops exactly where main.py would enter the
loop it never leaves.

It is deliberately the same path rather than a smaller one. MLOperator.init() is
what sets the tracking URI, connects to Ray, calls train() and registers the
result, so a run started here does what the deployed operator does when it first
comes up. ODE adds only the commit tag on the run.

ODE runs this file. It is yours to change, but keep the init()/train_once() pair
at the end: everything a run records happens inside one of the two.

Needs Operator Lib v1.5.0 or newer, which pyproject.toml pins, and v1.7.0 for a
session with a data split.
